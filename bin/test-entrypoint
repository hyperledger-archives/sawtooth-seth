# The rest api may be slow to start up, and our tests are quick to
# start up. The tests may then fail when attempting to connect to
# the rest api. This is a convenience script that waits for the
# rest api to be up to the point where it can accept http connections,
# and then runs the command passed in to it. Fails after 10 attempts.
#
# Example usage:
#
#     test-entrypoint go test foo.go
