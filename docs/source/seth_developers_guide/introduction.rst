Introduction

The primary goal of the Sawtooth-Ethereum integration project 'Seth'
is to add support for running Ethereum Virtual Machine smart
contracts to the Hyperledger Sawtooth platform. In order to make this possible,
the Hyperledger Sawtooth project worked with the `Hyperledger Burrow`_ project
to integrate their EVM implementation, the Burrow EVM, into with the Hyperledger
Sawtooth platform.

The secondary goal of Seth is to make it easy to port existing EVM smart
contracts and DApps that depend on them to Sawtooth. This has been largely
accomplished by replicating the `Ethereum JSON RPC API`_.

Seth is composed of three components:

1. The :ref:`seth <seth-cli-reference-label>` client
#. The :ref:`seth-tp <seth-tp-reference-label>` transaction processor
#. The :ref:`seth-rpc <seth-rpc-reference-label>` server

The ``seth`` client is the user-facing CLI tool for interacting with a Sawtooth
network that has Seth deployed on it. The ``seth-tp`` transaction processor is
the component that implements 'Ethereum-like' functionality within the Sawtooth
platform. Running Seth on a Sawtooth network is equivalent to connecting a
``seth-tp`` process to all validator nodes. The ``seth-rpc`` server is an HTTP
server that acts as an adapter between the `Ethereum JSON RPC API`_ and the
client interface provided by Sawtooth.

It is important to note that Seth is not a complete Ethereum implementation. The
Sawtooth platform has made fundamental design decisions that differ from those
made by the Ethereum platform. While most EVM smart contracts can be run on the
Sawtooth network, there are some differences to be aware of:

1. Blocks within Sawtooth are not identified by a 32-byte block hash. They are
   instead identified by a 64-byte header signature. When running smart
   contracts that use the BLOCKHASH instruction, the first 32 bytes of the
   header signature are used in place of a block hash.
#. The public Ethereum network depends on economic incentives to limit execution
   resources. On the other hand, the Hyperledger Burrow project depends on
   permissions to control and limit execution resources. Seth currently only
   supports the permissioned-network model. As a consequence, 'gas' is free but
   finite and permissions can be applied to all accounts.
#. Transaction execution within Sawtooth is modularized so that transactions
   cannot have knowledge of being executed within the context of a block chain.
   This feature has useful implications from a design perspective, such as
   simplifying the Sawtooth state transaction function. However, it is in
   direct opposition to transaction execution within Ethereum, in which
   transactions can depend on the block numbers, hashes, and timestamps. By
   default, these instructions are not supported by Seth. However, if the Block
   Info Transaction Family is running on the same network as Seth, these
   instructions will attempt to read from state at the addresses defined by that
   family.
