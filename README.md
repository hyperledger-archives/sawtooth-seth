Hyperledger Sawtooth - Seth
-------------

This project is an Ethereum-compatible transaction family for the Hyperledger
Sawtooth platform.

The primary goal of the Sawtooth-Ethereum integration project, affectionately
dubbed "Seth", is to add support for running Ethereum Virtual Machine smart
contracts to the Hyperledger Sawtooth platform. In order to make this possible,
the Hyperledger Sawtooth project worked with the
[Hyperledger Burrow](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow) project to integrate
their EVM implementation, the Burrow EVM, into with the Hyperledger Sawtooth
platform.
